# Sleep-State-Classifier
Segment from main codebase detailing the methods for neural network enhanced sleep state classification. This project has been deployed for internal usage.

# Demo
A Jupyter Notebook is available for some basic visualizations of the dataset. Majority of the pre-processing is performed via MATLAB. 

# Build Requirements
This project was built on Python 3.6. An Anaconda environment in ```./configs/environment.yml``` is prepared for installation for new users. 

# Usage
```main.py``` can be used to explore the model creation. Can create SleepClassifier class and call ```fit()``` or ```predict()```
